# MP3FileManager
MP3 File Manager - manages metatags and updates the specified library with matching (hopefully) higher-quality files, if specified.

I primarily wrote MP3FileManager for replacing lower-quality mp3 files with higher-quality mp3 files.  The problem was that the lower-quality files already had proper metadata, and the high-quality files had better quality, but very little metadata.  So this app allows me to point to my music library and essentially copy the metadata for matching files, and replace the lower-quality file in the library with the higher-quality file.
